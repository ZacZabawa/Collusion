            "content": "\nAbstract:\nThis research intertwines Peircean pragmaticism, North American Indigenous traditions, and archival science with the aim of preparing settler institutions, archives, and science for respectful and fruitful engagement with Indigenous nations in both physical and digital places. Seeking to amend, not replace current reconciliation approaches and rights-based frameworks, the study emphasizes the necessity for serious reevaluation of identities, narratives, and processes within the evolving archival landscape, which is being simultaneously challenged by the introduction digital technologies, resurgent community and nationalistic politics, and ecological instability.\n\nIn the major topic area, the research investigates the potential of Charles Sanders Peirce's community-minded and logically coherent pragmaticism to serve as a bridge between traditional and postmodern archival thought and practice, particularly in the context of digital communication, representation, and, potentially, decolonization. Recognizing archives as both places for remembering and forgetting, it offers an additional purpose, archives as potential sources of abductive inspiration like nature itself. If we can devise means for appraisal to reject the common tendency towards elite capture of resources and attention in academic, artistic, and financial systems and find holistic and systematic ways to identify records outside of current lineages of power. Then archives may be uniquely useful in the pantheon of science for generating new theories of the past, present, and future rather than repeatedly testing along known binaries or prodigious events. To explore the abductive potential of archives, it interrogates responsible decentralization in archival selection, arrangement, and description through Mary Parker Follet’s (1948) pragmaticist inspired integrative democracy and Kenneth Thibodeau’s (2022) semiotic archival engineering to amend current top-down decision-makingand control structures that artificially limits the archival imagination and body in human and non-human domains.\n\nIn the minor topic area, the research traces the pragmaticist developments proposed in the major area to the context of Indigenous worldviews, sovereignty, cultural revitalization, and community engagement in North America. It argues that archives, when approached from a pragmaticist perspective that logically leaves room for spirituality and community-specific determinations of meaning can serve as a powerful tool for Indigenous communities to interrogate and assert their narratives, histories, and identities. But only when its designers can recognize Indigenous methods for intergenerational and intercultural communication as equally valid and worthy of significant attention by those concerned with accurate and actionable societal memory. The study seeks to emphasizes the fundamental importance of incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems, protocols, and attention to place into the entire archival body, by those with the authority to do so to ensure respectful, meaningful, and mutually beneficial engagement.\n\nThe research underscores the speculative historical and theoretical connections between pragmatic and Indigenous thought as spoken to by Pratt (2002), highlighting their shared focus on love, action, context, community, and growth. It advocates, like others before, for the development of archival technologies lockstep with communities that embody these principles, to create models, theory, and collaborative opportunities for others without direct experience in direct democratic traditions to learn from and experiment with. These technologies are envisioned along the lines of a ‘semiotic web’ are not just as tools for accountability or future understanding, but reflective of collective values, core to our fluid organizational processes, catalysts for never-ending dialogue, and platforms for more easily conceptualizing the diverse perspectives held within any community. It is argued archival record-keeping system must capture complex deliberative processes as living signs immutably tied to their creators and users, creating digital platforms that foster collaboration and enrich dynamic community-specific records beyond singular static representations such as meeting minutes in favor of a multiplicity of interpretations. These recommendations are in line with current Indigenous archival perspectives for multiple provenance and ongoing participatory curation, in addition to offering new methods and justifications for randomized and participatory archival selection. Given the immense scope proposed, the researcher makes no claims to truth and invites further exploration and participation in this ongoing dialogue of knowledge creation, dissemination, and action.",

            "content": "\n\n\nThis article focuses on emerging decentralized recordkeeping technologies that theoretically enable direct democratic platform governance by an interoperable, non-hierarchical, self-sovereign node network. Specifically, the paper frames blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) as a technology of con- textualization, localization, and coalition-building when coupled with small-scale democratic consensus and respect for individual sovereignty. On a global level, DAO’s capability to tie platform governance to the temporality of each node’s internal consensus possesses distinct opportunities and tools to re-balance our information and governance systems in favor of consensus and resiliency across group boundaries. The hypothetical knowledge-sharing system outlined here is exploratory and meant to generate imaginative discussions around a lesser-known aspect of blockchain-enabled systems, far beyond the hyper-financialization of cryptocurrencies. With a proliferation of solutions promising data sovereignty in technology circles and clear interest by Indigenous leadership, the author proposes a platform for immediate sovereign data storage with an integrated testing environment for understanding emerging incentives and models for collaboration.",
